What am I --
clorene, a simple OpenCL driver for the CPU.
Work in Progress, tinkering around with building an OpenCL runtime.

Prerequisites --
* Poco, v1.4.2p1, available at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/poco/files/sources/poco-1.4.2/poco-1.4.2p1.tar.gz/download
(I have a local patch for certain functionality which may appear soon).
* LLVM/Clang, from svn (see http://llvm.org)
* waf build tool (1.6.8)
* Google Test (gtest) for tests.

Why --
There are a lot of interesting tools involved, and I am becoming more
and more of an LLVM fan.  And, its fun!

What this isn't --
Anywhere close to a full OpenCL implementation...I was mostly wanting to
sketch out for myself how some of the pieces fit together.

Inspirations --
Also check out Clover, a Mesa OpenCL driver project.
